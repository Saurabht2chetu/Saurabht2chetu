# What is React
* React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
* It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
* It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
* Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it.

# Major Features of React
* It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
* It uses server-side rendering.
* It follows uni-directional data flow or data binding.

# What is JSX
JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. This is a type of file used by React which utilizes the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. This makes the HTML file really easy to understand. This file makes applications robust and boosts its performance.

# What are Pure Components?
Pure components are the simplest and fastest components which can be written. They can replace any component which only has a render(). These components enhance the simplicity of the code and performance of the application.

# What is state in React?
States are the heart of React components. States are the source of data and must be kept as simple as possible. Basically, states are the objects which determine components rendering and behavior. They are mutable unlike the props and create dynamic and interactive components. They are accessed via this.state().

# What are Props in React?
Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are read-only components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. They are always passed down from the parent to the child components throughout the application. A child component can never send a prop back to the parent component. This help in maintaining the unidirectional data flow and are generally used to render the dynamically generated data.
